Laziest Coding Standard
-----------------------

This project contains several sample files to show my personal preferred coding style. My style is the coding standard for current project.

There is no descriptive text in these samples. I won't say anything about how I write code. Just open source file and see what I've done.

I hope all of my co-workers would use the same coding standard. If my preferred way doesn't look good, ask me to change or send me pull request. Don't worry. I'm not that hard to be persuaded. :P
